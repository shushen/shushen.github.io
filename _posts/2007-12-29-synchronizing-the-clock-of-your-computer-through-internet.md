According to a white paper from [Symmetricom](http://www.ntp-systems.com/), key areas where time synchronization directly effects network operations are [1]:
                
&#8226; Log file accuracy, auditing & monitoring
                
&#8226; Network fault diagnosis and recovery
                
&#8226; File time stamps
                
&#8226; Directory services
                
&#8226; Access security and authentication
                
&#8226; Distributed computing
                
&#8226; Scheduled operations
                
&#8226; Real-world time values

For personal computer users, having the clock synchronized is also very helpful in daily life. I would suggest everyone of you have your computer synchronized, as long as you have access to Internet.

It&#8217;s very easy to synchronize the clock of your computer to the widely available time sources through Internet. There are actually quite a lot of software that enable you to do this under both Windows and Linux operating systems. Windows XP itself includes such time service and you don&#8217;t even need any third party software to do that.

To find out more:

[1] [The Importance of Network Time Synchronization](http://www.ntp-systems.com/pdf/imp_netsync.pdf), [](http://www.ntp-systems.com/)a white paper from [Symmetricom](http://www.ntp-systems.com/)

[2] [Symmetricom](http://www.ntp-systems.com/), this is a company in the business of provide Network Time Synchronization equipments and solutions. They also provides many free softwares that would be quite useful for PC users, as well as network administrators. I find their website through a google search when I tried to find out what time zone that "EDT" stands for.

[3] To find out how to setup WindowsXP to automatically synchronize the clock, open help in WindowXP, and search for the keywords "Synchronizing your computer clock", then you will find an artical on how to do this. Not that WindowsXP Professional would provide network time synchronization service when the computer is not a member of domain, see details in Microsoft Knowledge Base, artical [289689.](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;289689)
