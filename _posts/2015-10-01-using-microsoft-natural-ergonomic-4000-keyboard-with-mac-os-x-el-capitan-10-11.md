Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 Keyboard is great to your wrist and hands for
people who uses keyboards a lot. It's a quite affordable keyboard as well
(~$50).

Microsoft provides Intellitype Pro 8.2 software/driver for Mac OS but the
official support ends with Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion). The software works to some
extent however with OS X 10.10 Yosemite, for example, you can still swap
Windows Key and Alt/Option key to match the layout of a Mac keyboard, which is
probably the only reason I'd need the Microsoft driver.

With the upgrade to El Capitan, Intellitype cannot even detect the keyboard any
more, so it becomes completely useless.

But there is a saviour,
[Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html.en), "A powerful and
stable keyboard customizer for OS X.". Karabiner utilizes Mac OS X
accessibility API and enables you to do whatever you want with keyboard mapping
plus many other things.

The wonderful thing to me is that Karabiner even has an option for Ergonomic
4000 keyboard! All I wanted can be archived by selecting a couple of options:

Update [Oct 15, 2015]

This is my configuration to also re-map the right `Alt` and `Menu` keys to
`Command-R` and `Option-R`: ![Karabiner settings for Microsoft Natural
