Thirty years have been a long time.

Lately I have been busy with my little boy, moving home to the new apartment at
suburb, and with my new position at the company. None of them is less
challenging and all of them are about family and career - the two themes of a
person's life.

At the age of 30, I'm glad that my boy is starting to having food by himself,
the moving has been finished, and I'm getting my hands on managing the team and
the projects.

What's coming up next?
