Reminds me how I did optimization of my simulation to reduce the running hours from ~ 72 hours to ~8 hours during my PhD research.

New hardware rocks and software matters. [NVIDIA Tesla Makes Personal SuperComputing A Reality](http://www.nvidia.com/object/io_1227008280995.html)

> SC08—AUSTIN, TX—NOVEMBER 18 2008— Today, scientific research is carried out on supercomputing clusters, a shared resource that consumes hundreds of kilowatts of power and costs millions of dollars to build and maintain. As a result, researchers must fight for time on these resources, slowing their work and delaying results. NVIDIA and its worldwide partners today announced the availability of the GPU-based Tesla™ Personal Supercomputer, which delivers the equivalent computing power of a cluster, at 1/100th of the price and in a form factor of a standard desktop workstation. 

And I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how [CUDA by NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html) may accelerate the video trans/encoding process. PowerDirector already supports CUDA, but is &#8220;[indeed limited to just a handful of video effects available](http://www.elitebastards.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=641&Itemid=29)&#8220;.
