More and more young couples, especially those who are getting married and have
bought an apartment during the booming real estate market back in March this
year, are turning to IKEA for their choice of furnitures and other consumer
products for daily life.

IKEA's marketing philosophy is making furnitures that are affordable for
people to replace at any time they want to. The paces of modern lives are
faster than ever and the need for furnitures and household products are also
changing at the same speed. A family of two may soon be ready to welcome their
baby and most likely would need to redecorate and buy a lot of completely
different products.

Having such philosophy in mind, IKEA equips itself with two sharp weapons to
penetrate and rule the market. The first weapon is environmental safety. IKEA
products do not come with strong smell of paintings - this is generally
perceived as no harmful substances are used in those products. This is an
extremely important factor that why people consider IKEA as their most
trustworthy supplier.

Parents are more than willing to pay more for safety, however, they will
definitely not complain if safety is offered at affordable prices. The approach
that IKEA takes to their product in terms of making, transporting, and selling
are all about how to lower the price as much as possible - which forms their
second deadly weapon - competitive prices. IKEA's products are designed in a
way so that they can be easily packed and take the least of space (and hence
the cost as well) when shipped from one continent to another. Customers are
encouraged to do-it-yourself to reduce cost at the mall, in delivery, as well
as for installation. IKEA has also taken great effort in finding and helping
suppliers to deliver best quality and lowest cost. As a result of all of above
factors, most product on IKEA's catalog have been continuously dropping prices
year over year.

I may not like all of IKEA's product - especially its mattress which are simply
way too soft and hurt my back. But you probably can tell that I'm a fan of IKEA
products and I'm very glad that I have this choice in the market when it comes
to family health and price for value.

After the break:

My family frequent visits IKEA Shanghai and most of our furnitures at home are
bought from IKEA. This afternoon when we were there to shop a desk for reading
room, it is quite obvious that this is an unusually crowded day.

Car park is full of cars and people no longer follow the rules:

My boy took a snap in the car so I was at the cafe for refreshment - thanks to
my wonderful wife - it's a new one at ground level nearby the main entrance. I
waited for a while to get a clean shot in which I do not have to [blur
somebody's face](http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9943140-7.html).

Banner "IKEA FOOD" - excuse me for white balance, N79 white balance doesn't
work as expected.

Hey, this is the queues at cashier. Can anybody count how many counter are over
there?

Crowd at the children's department - unfortunately this shot does not give you
the exact feeling of how crowded it was.
