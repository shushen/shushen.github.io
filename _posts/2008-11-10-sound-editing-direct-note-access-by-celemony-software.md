Off-key note when singing or playing musical instruments?

Came cross article &#8220;_Company Puts a New Spin on Music-Editing Software_&#8221; on Sept 08 issue of IEEE Computer Magazine:

> Direct Note Access, on the other hand, could change a single note in a guitar chord without affecting the sound of the other notes or edit single pitches in a song with more than one note playing at a time. It could also correct out-of-tune harmony vocals or fix their timing, turn major chords to minor and vice versa, switch tone scales, mute single notes, and remix volume levels. 

See the introduction movie from celemony below:
