A large number of files to backup just in case your laptop breaks down?

Having tried commercial backup solution and overwhelmed by their complexity and overpricing?

Frustrated by stupid rsync, whose as stupid protocol isn&#8217;t even inter-working with itself?

Then go and give Unison a try &#8211; it&#8217;s cross platform and won&#8217;t let you down.

Of course, an even ambitious (and could be every useful) file backup system is git-based gibak. I haven&#8217;t (yet) had time and disk space to try it out, but I would think it&#8217;s very cool &#8211; after all, as Linus said, git was built with file systems in mind.
