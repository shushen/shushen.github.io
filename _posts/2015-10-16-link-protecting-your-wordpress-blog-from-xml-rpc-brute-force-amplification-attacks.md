From [Protecting Your WordPress Blog From XML-RPC Brute Force Amplification
Attacks](https://pop.co/blog/protecting-your-wordpress-blog-from-xmlrpc-brute-force-amplification-attacks/):

> To summarize, attackers are taking advantage of a vulnerability in
> WordPressâ€™s XML-RPC system.multicall method which effectively allows them to
> issue hundreds of login attempts with a single request. To put it another
> way, this is an extreme case of brute forcing logins in an attempt to
> determine your administrative user credentials.

Validate the change as suggested from a comment of the above link (xml-rpc
should be disabled):

> You can check if XML-RPC is enabled on your site with [this tool](http://xmlrpc.eritreo.it/)
