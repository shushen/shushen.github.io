Thanks to Leo Davidson who has this fixed &#8211; it was pain in the arse to have Adobe preview handler broken in Windows 7 x64 version. Adobe&#8217;s image is down quite a lot for not responding to this installer&#8217;s bug after 2 years it was found. Shame!

Go to for a fix &#8211; it&#8217;s as simple as changing a key string in the registry &#8211; if you suffers the same problem:
